cryptsetup: mount encrypted drive

The first step is to get the name of the encrypted partition, with the following command:

blkid | grep crypto

sample output:
/dev/sda2: UUID="VERY LONG NUMBER" TYPE="crypto_LUKS"

Now we know the name of the partition /dev/sda2. The next step is to open the partition and set up a mapping name:
cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda2/ 

Mount it:
mount /dev/xubuntu-vg/root /mnt

Now the partition is decrypted and mounted and you are able to access your files.
